So what I wanted to do was create a Jarvis but I wanted to have is called GABIS which is short 
for my brothers nickname Gabe he had an accident and died and I wanted to continue to 
remembering him by Jarvis since he loved the marvel films and wanted to carry on his legacy in 
a way and this is what I could think about. I hope to add features overtime and I especially
want to see if theres a way to use his voice. GABIS stands for Gabe's Artifical Brothers
Intelligence System.
